# **App Name**: Pocket Pal

## Core Features:

- Pet Display: Display a cute animated pet on the screen. The pet will have different forms to indicate its mood, or stages of development.
- Status Indicators: Display different status meters (hunger, happiness, cleanliness) to indicate the pet's needs.
- Interaction Controls: Include interactive buttons or gestures that simulate caring actions like feeding, playing, and cleaning.
- Pet Behavior Simulation: Use a basic behavior model tool that determines the pet's state changes based on the player's interactions. When needs are not met, determine what the pet needs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Pastel color palette to enhance the cute and gentle aesthetic of the app.
- Use a gentle green (#83E377) as the primary accent color for interactive elements.
- Use clear, readable fonts to clearly communicate state. Titles can be of medium weight while the description and helper texts use a lighter weight.
- Soft and rounded icons. No hard edges.
- Clean layout to prevent distraction
- Gentle animations for all interactions.
